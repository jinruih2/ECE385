\section{Introduction}
% Summarize the basic functionality of the multiplier circuit

In this report, we describe the multiplier circuit that is capable of conducting multiplication between two 8-bit 2's complement numbers. 

The multiplier is consisted of two 8-bit registers $A$ and $B$, one 1-bit register $X$, 8-bit switches $S$, four 7-segment $Hex$ displays, and two buttons \Circled{Run} and \Circled{Load-Clear-Reset}. 

To conduct the multiplication operation, the \texttt{multiplicand} is first set on the switches, and then loaded into the register $B$ when \Circled{Load-Clear-Reset} is pushed and released. The \texttt{multiplier} is set and stays on the switches $S$. When the \Circled{Run} button is pushed, the final 16-bit result will be computed. It will be stored in registers $AB$ and displayed on the $Hex$ displays. The multiplier also supports consecutive multiplication, which uses the previous result as the multiplicand in the next round of calculation.

In the rest of this report, multiple aspects relevant to the multiplier are covered. We start off with answering the pre-lab question in \refsec{sec:pre-lab}. Then, the written description and diagrams of the multiplier circuit are provided in \refsec{sec:written-description}.


\section{Pre-Lab Question}
\label{sec:pre-lab}
In this section we answer the question asked in the pre-lab part of the Experiment \#4 manual\footnote{See \url{https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ECE385FA22/Lab+4}}.

\textbf{Question:} Rework the multiplication example on page 5.2 of the lab manual, as in compute 11000101 * 00000111 in a table like the example. Note that the order of the multiplicand and multiplier are reversed from the example.

\textbf{Answer:} Initial Values: X = 0, A = 00000000, B = 11000101 (achieved using ClearA\_LoadB signal), S = 00000111, M is the least significant bit of the multiplier (Register B). The calculating process can be found in \reftab{tab:pre-lab}.

\section{Written Description and Diagrams of Multiplier Circuit}
\label{sec:written-description}

\subsection{Summary of Operation}
% Explain in words how operands are loaded, how the multiplier computes its result, how the result is stored, etc.
The operation has three major stages: 1) the operands being loaded, 2) the multiplier computing the result, and 3) the result being stored and displayed.

To load the operands, the \texttt{multiplicand} is first set on the switches, and then loaded into the register $B$ when \Circled{Load-Clear-Reset} is pushed and released. This is done by connecting the \texttt{Load} port of register $B$ to the signal generated by the button. The \texttt{multiplier} is set and stays on the switches $S$. 

To compute the result, the multiplier utilizes a \texttt{Finite State Machine}, an \texttt{Add/Subtract} module, and a \Circled{Run} button. When the button is pushed, the \texttt{Finite State Machine} starts transitioning and generating control signals according to the given multiplication algorithm. The \texttt{Add/Subtract} module takes in the control signals, carries out the algorithm by adding to / subtracting from the shift registers.

To store and display the result is a trivial process. When the final 16-bit result is computed, it resides in the concatenation of the registers $AB$ which is connected to the $Hex$ display digits. 

The multiplier also supports consecutive multiplication, which uses the previous result as the multiplicand in the next round of calculation. This is achieved naturally with the design of the multiplier described above. Note that the result will be truncated into 8-bits when regarded as an operand, so when the result is higher than 8-bit this feature will be malfunctioning.

The top level block diagram can be found in \reffig{fig:top_level}. From left to right there are four major components of the circuit: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{Control} module that generates control signals which are utilized by other components.
    \item The \texttt{Add/Subtract} module that takes in control signals and manipulate register values accordingly.
    \item The \texttt{Register} module that load and stores operands, intermediate values, and final compuation results.
    \item The \texttt{Display} module that consists of four $Hex$ displays connected to Register $A$ and $B$ for displaying register values.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State Diagram for Control Unit}
% This can be done in a program like Visio, but if the Quartus state diagram generator is used, you must label the states and transitions. By default, the tool does not generate a very legible state diagram.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fsm_chart.pdf}
    \caption{The State Diagram of the Finite State Machine in the Control Module. }
    \label{fig:state}
\end{figure}

At the state ``SUB8'' or states with names of the shape ``ADD\#'', the control signals depend on the last bit of Register $B$ (\ie, $M$). When $M$ is a logical one, $Shift = 1$, $Add = 1$, $Sub = 0$ for ``ADD\#'' and $Shift = 1$, $Add = 0$, $Sub = 1$ for ``SUB8'', otherwise $Shift = 0$, $Add = 0$, $Sub = 0$.

At the states with names of the shape ``SHIFT\#'', the control signals generated will be $Shift = 1$, $Add = 0$, $Sub = 0$.

To optimize the design's maximum frequency, we can switch from the Carry Ripple Adder to a Carry Select Adder, so that the latency for the addition or subtraction can be reduced.

\subsection{Written Questions}
In this section we answer the questions that requires a written response proposed in the Post-Lab section.

\subsubsection{What is the purpose of the X register? When does the X register get set/cleared?}
The purpose of the Register $X$ in our design is to enable arithmetic shift during the computation, which keeps the value's sign bit when conducting right-shifting. Register $X$ is critical because it keeps track of the sign bit of Register $A$, which will be placed as the new most significant bit after a shift on Register $A$ has been finished.


\subsubsection{What would happen if you used the carry out of an 8-bit adder instead of output of a 9-bit adder for X?}
If the carry out of an 8-bit adder is used instead, the behavior will be incorrect. Under cases where a negative result does not generate a carry out (\eg, -1d + 0d), or where a positive result generates a carry out (\eg, -1d + 2d), the carry out cannot correctly reflect the sign bit of the final result and will lead to erroneous behavior.


\subsubsection{What are the limitations of continuous multiplications? Under what circumstances will the implemented algorithm fail?}
Between two runs of the multiplication, the Register $A$ and $X$ will be cleared since they will be used to hold data in the compuation process. This leads to the behavior that the result will be truncated to the length same to that of Register $B$, which is 8 bits. This will not be an issue when the final result's value is persisted after the truncation, however when the absolute value of the number is larger than a threshold (in our case, $\geq 256d$ or $\leq -256d$), the result will be incorrect and the continuous multiplication will fail.


\subsubsection{What are the advantages (and disadvantages?) of the implemented multiplication algorithm over the pencil-and-paper method discussed in the introduction?}


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages}: it is making full use of the shift register where each bit of the registers is taking a piece of working information during each time step of the process, thus it avoids wasting hardware resources on the FPGA, comparing to the pencil-and-paper algorithm where the storage and summation of eight 16-bit intermediate result are needed.
    
    \item \textbf{Disadvantages}: the algorithm itself is less intuitive, and the implementation is less straightforward.
\end{itemize} 


\section{Conclusion}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Discuss functionality of your design. If parts of your design did not work, discuss what could be done to fix it.
%     \item Was there anything ambiguous, incorrect, or unnecessarily difficult in the lab manual or given materials which can be improved for next semester? You can also specify what we did right, so it does not get changed.
% \end{itemize}
\subsection{Functionality Discussion}
In this experiment, we implemented the Multiplier circuit capable of conducting multiplication between two 8-bit 2's complement numbers. 

To conduct the multiplication operation, the \texttt{multiplicand} is first set on the switches, and then loaded into the register $B$ when \Circled{Load-Clear-Reset} is pushed and released. The \texttt{multiplier} is set and stays on the switches $S$. When the \Circled{Run} button is pushed, the final 16-bit result will be computed. It will be stored in registers $AB$ and displayed on the $Hex$ displays. The multiplier also supports consecutive multiplication, which uses the previous result as the multiplicand in the next round of calculation.


\subsection{Lab Manual Suggestions}
The lab manuals are of high-quality, they are clear, easy to follow, and have very few things that can be better. One such thing is that the indexing can be more consistent. For instance the title of the manual pdf itself says Experiment 8 which is not true, and on page 5.8 it says ``fill in the table shown on 5.6 with your design's statistics'', but the table is on page 4.7.
